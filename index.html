                <p>I'm a current junior at Harvard College studying computer science. </p>
                <p>In the past, I have worked for <a href = "https://www.redhat.com/en">Red Hat</a>, <a href = "https://www.gcash.com/">GCash</a>, and <a href = "https://www.novid.org/">NOVID</a>.</p>
                <p>I have also been a teaching fellow for CS50 and CS32, Harvard's flagship intro CS classes.</p>
                <p>I was born and raised in Bacolod City, Philippines, went to boarding school in the foothills of the Himalayas in India, and now call the perplexing one-way streets of Boston my home.</p>
                <p>I love meeting new people and learning about their stories.</p>
